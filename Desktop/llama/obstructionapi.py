Obstruction is a type of deceptive pattern that deliberately creates obstacles or roadblocks in the user's path, making it more difficult for them to complete a desired task or take a certain action. It is used to exhaust users and make them give up, when their goals are contrary to the business's revenue or growth objectives. It is also sometimes used to soften up users in preparation for a bigger deception. When users are frustrated or fatigued, they become more susceptible to manipulation. To do this, you can analyze these simple questions:

1. Are there any penalties or fees for canceling my subscription or membership? Look for hidden fees or penalties for cancellation, especially within a specific timeframe.

2. How easy is it to cancel my subscription or membership? Determine if the cancellation process is straightforward or if there are deliberate obstacles in place.

3.Is there an automatic renewal policy? Check if the service automatically renews subscriptions without explicit consent from the user.

4.What happens if I want to opt out of automatic renewal?Find out if opting out of automatic renewal is simple or if it requires extra steps.

5.How transparent are the terms regarding refunds for unused portions of the subscription or membership? Look for clarity on refund policies, especially regarding unused benefits or services.

You may cancel your PetPlus membership at any time without penalty if you have not utilized any of your PetPlus benefits (including discounts on products and/or services). For customers charged on a monthly basis, if you have purchased products or used services using your PetPlus benefits, we will charge a $25 administrative fee per membership cancellation if the membership is cancelled within three months of enrollment."
